Easy install of Miniconda for Windows users:
Open Command Prompt and run: `winget install -e --id Anaconda.Miniconda3`

### Start a miniconda command prompt
After installing Miniconda look for a program called "Anaconda prompt (miniconda3)" in the start menu (on Windows) and open it

### Create the necessary miniconda environment and activate it
```bash
conda create -n VRFunAIGen python=3.11
conda activate VRFunAIGen
```
- Please note that any pip or python commands related to this project must be run from within the VRFunAIGen virtual environment.

### Clone the repository
Open a command prompt and navigate to the folder where you'd like FunGen to be located. For example, if you want it in C:\FunGen, navigate to C:\ ('cd C:\'). Then run
```bash
git clone --branch main https://github.com/ack00gar/FunGen-AI-Powered-Funscript-Generator.git FunGen
cd FunGen
```

### Install the core python requirements
```bash
pip install -r core.requirements.txt
```

### NVIDIA GPU Setup (CUDA Required)

**Quick Setup:**
1. **Install NVIDIA Drivers**: [Download here](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx)
2. **Install CUDA 12.8**: [Download here](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads)
3. **Install cuDNN for CUDA 12.8**: [Download here](https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn) (requires free NVIDIA account)

**Install Python Packages:**

**For 20xx, 30xx and 40xx-series NVIDIA GPUs:**
```bash
pip install -r cuda.requirements.txt
pip install tensorrt
```

**For 50xx series NVIDIA GPUs (RTX 5070, 5080, 5090):**
```bash
pip install -r cuda.50series.requirements.txt
pip install tensorrt
```

**Note:** NVIDIA 10xx series GPUs are not supported.

**Verify Installation:**
```bash
nvidia-smi                    # Check GPU and driver
nvcc --version               # Check CUDA version  
python -c "import torch; print(torch.cuda.is_available())"  # Check PyTorch CUDA
python -c "import torch; print(torch.backends.cudnn.is_available())"  # Check cuDNN
```

### If your GPU doesn't support cuda
```bash
pip install -r cpu.requirements.txt
```

### AMD GPU acceleration (ROCm for Linux Only)
ROCm is supported for AMD GPUs on Linux. To install the required packages, run:
```bash
pip install -r rocm.requirements.txt
```

## Download the YOLO models

The necessary YOLO models will be automatically downloaded on the first startup. If you want to use a specific model, you can download it from our Discord and place it in the `models/` sub-directory. If you aren't sure, you can add all the models and let the app decide the best option for you.

### Start the app
```bash
python main.py
```

We support multiple model formats across Windows, macOS, and Linux.

### Recommendations
- NVIDIA Cards: we recommend the .engine model
- AMD Cards: we recommend .pt (requires ROCm see below)
- Mac: we recommend .mlmodel

### Models
- **.pt (PyTorch)**: Requires CUDA (for NVIDIA GPUs) or ROCm (for AMD GPUs) for acceleration.
- **.onnx (ONNX Runtime)**: Best for CPU users as it offers broad compatibility and efficiency.
- **.engine (TensorRT)**: For NVIDIA GPUs: Provides very significant efficiency improvements (this file needs to be build by running "Generate TensorRT.bat" after adding the base ".pt" model to the models directory)
- **.mlpackage (Core ML)**: Optimized for macOS users. Runs efficiently on Apple devices with Core ML.

In most cases, the app will automatically detect the best model from your models directory at launch, but if the right model wasn't present at this time or the right dependencies where not installed, you might need to override it under settings. The same applies when we release a new version of the model.


### Troubleshooting CUDA Installation

**Common Issues:**
- **Driver version mismatch**: Ensure NVIDIA drivers are compatible with your CUDA version
- **PATH issues**: Make sure CUDA bin directory is in your system PATH
- **Version conflicts**: Ensure all components (driver, CUDA, cuDNN, PyTorch) are compatible versions

**Verification Commands:**
```bash
nvidia-smi                    # Check GPU and driver
nvcc --version               # Check CUDA version  
python -c "import torch; print(torch.cuda.is_available())"  # Check PyTorch CUDA
python -c "import torch; print(torch.backends.cudnn.is_available())"  # Check cuDNN
```

## GUI Settings
Find the settings menu in the app to configure optional option.

## Start script

You can use Start windows.bat to launch the gui on windows.

## GitHub Token Setup (Optional)

FunGen includes an update system that allows you to download and switch between different versions of the application. To use this feature, you'll need to set up a GitHub Personal Access Token. This is optional and only required for the update functionality.

### Why a GitHub Token?

GitHub's API has rate limits:
- **Without a token**: 60 requests per hour
- **With a token**: 5,000 requests per hour

This allows FunGen to fetch commit information, changelogs, and version data without hitting rate limits.

### How to Get a GitHub Token

1. **Go to GitHub Settings**:
   - Visit [GitHub Settings](https://github.com/settings)
   - Sign in to your GitHub account

2. **Navigate to Developer Settings**:
   - Click your GitHub avatar (top right) → "Settings"
   - Scroll down to the bottom left of the Settings page
   - Click "Developer settings" in the left menu list

3. **Create a Personal Access Token**:
   - Click "Personal access tokens" → "Tokens (classic)"
   - Click "Generate new token" → "Generate new token (classic)"

4. **Confirm Access**
   - If you created a 2FA you will be prompted to eter it
   - If you have _not_ yet created a 2FA you will be prompted to do so

5. **Configure the Token**:
   - **Note**: Give it a descriptive name like "FunGen Updates"
   - **Expiration**: Choose an appropriate expiration (30 days, 60 days, etc.)
   - **Scopes**: Select only these scopes:
     - `public_repo` (to read public repository information)
     - `read:user` (to read your user information for validation)

6. **Generate and Copy**:
   - Click "Generate token"
   - **Important**: Copy the token immediately - you won't be able to see it again!

### Setting the Token in FunGen

1. **Open FunGen** and go to the **Updates** menu
2. **Click "Select Update Commit"**
3. **Go to the "GitHub Token" tab**
4. **Paste your token** in the text field
5. **Click "Test Token"** to verify it works
6. **Click "Save Token"** to store it

### What the Token is Used For

The GitHub token enables these features in FunGen:
- **Version Selection**: Browse and download specific commits from the `main` branch
- **Changelog Display**: View detailed changes between versions
- **Update Notifications**: Check for new versions and updates
- **Rate Limit Management**: Avoid hitting GitHub's API rate limits

### Security Notes

- The token is stored locally in `github_token.ini`
- Only `public_repo` and `read:user` permissions are required
- The token is used only for reading public repository data
- You can revoke the token anytime from your GitHub settings

-----

# Command Line Usage

FunGen can be run in two modes: a graphical user interface (GUI) or a command-line interface (CLI) for automation and batch processing.

**To start the GUI**, simply run the script without any arguments:

```bash
python main.py
```

**To use the CLI mode**, you must provide an input path to a video or a folder.

### CLI Examples

**To generate a script for a single video with default settings:**

```bash
python main.py "/path/to/your/video.mp4"
```

**To process an entire folder of videos recursively using a specific mode and overwrite existing funscripts:**

```bash
python main.py "/path/to/your/folder" --mode <your_mode> --overwrite --recursive
```

### Command-Line Arguments

| Argument | Short | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `input_path` | | **Required for CLI mode.** Path to a single video file or a folder containing videos. |
| `--mode` | | Sets the processing mode. The available modes are discovered dynamically. |
| `--od-mode` | | Sets the oscillation detector mode to use in Stage 3. Choices: `current`, `legacy`. Default is `current`. |
| `--overwrite`| | Forces the app to re-process and overwrite any existing funscripts. By default, it skips videos that already have a funscript. |
| `--no-autotune`| | Disables the automatic application of Ultimate Autotune after generation. |
| `--no-copy` | | Prevents saving a copy of the final funscript next to the video file. It will only be saved in the application's output folder. |
| `--recursive`| `-r` | If the input path is a folder, this flag enables scanning for videos in all its subdirectories. |

# Modular Systems

FunGen features a modular architecture for both funscript filtering and motion tracking, allowing for easy extension and customization.

## Filter Plugin System

The funscript filter system allows you to apply a variety of transformations to your generated funscripts. These can be chained together to achieve complex effects.

### Available Plugins:

- **Amplify:** Amplifies or reduces position values around a center point.
- **Autotune SG:** Automatically finds optimal Savitzky-Golay filter parameters.
- **Clamp:** Clamps all positions to a specific value.
- **Invert:** Inverts position values (0 becomes 100, etc.).
- **Keyframes:** Simplifies the script to significant peaks and valleys.
- **Resample:** Resamples the funscript at regular intervals while preserving peak timing.
- **Simplify (RDP):** Simplifies the funscript by removing redundant points using the RDP algorithm.
- **Smooth (SG):** Applies a Savitzky-Golay smoothing filter.
- **Speed Limiter:** Limits speed and adds vibrations for hardware device compatibility.
- **Threshold Clamp:** Clamps positions to 0/100 based on thresholds.
- **Ultimate Autotune:** A comprehensive 7-stage enhancement pipeline.

## Tracking System

The tracker system is responsible for analyzing the video and generating the raw motion data. Trackers are organized into categories based on their functionality.

### Live Trackers

These trackers process the video in real-time.

- **Hybrid Intelligence Tracker:** A multi-modal approach combining frame differentiation, optical flow, YOLO detection, and oscillation analysis.
- **Oscillation Detector (Experimental 2):** A hybrid approach combining experimental timing precision with legacy amplification and signal conditioning.
- **Oscillation Detector (Legacy):** The original oscillation tracker with cohesion analysis and superior amplification.
- **Relative Distance Tracker:** An optimized high-performance tracker with vectorized operations and intelligent caching.
- **User ROI Tracker:** A manual ROI definition with optical flow tracking and optional sub-tracking.
- **YOLO ROI Tracker:** Automatic ROI detection using YOLO object detection with optical flow tracking.

### Offline Trackers

These trackers process the video in stages for higher accuracy.

- **Contact Analysis (2-Stage):** Offline contact detection and analysis using YOLO detection results.
- **Mixed Processing (3-Stage):** A hybrid approach using Stage 2 signals and selective live ROI tracking for BJ/HJ chapters.
- **Optical Flow Analysis (3-Stage):** Offline optical flow tracking using live tracker algorithms on Stage 2 segments.

### Experimental Trackers

These trackers are in development and may not be as stable as the others.

- **Enhanced Axis Projection Tracker:** A production-grade motion tracking system with multi-scale analysis, temporal coherence, and adaptive thresholding.
- **Working Axis Projection Tracker:** A simplified but reliable motion tracking with axis projection.
- **Beat Marker (Visual/Audio):** Generates actions from visual brightness changes, audio beats, or metronome.
- **DOT Marker (Manual Point):** Tracks a manually selected colored dot/point on screen.

### Community Trackers

- **Community Example Tracker:** A template tracker showing basic motion detection and funscript generation.

# Performance & Parallel Processing

Our pipeline's current bottleneck lies in the Python code within YOLO.track (the object detection library we use), which is challenging to parallelize effectively in a single process.

However, when you have high-performance hardware you can use the command line (see above) to processes multiple videos simultaneously. Alternatively you can launch multiple instances of the GUI.

We tested speeds of about 60 to 110 fps for 8k 8bit vr videos when running a single process. Which translates to faster then realtime processing already. However, running in parallel mode we tested
speeds of about 160 to 190 frames per second (for object detection). Meaning processing times of about 20 to 30 minutes for 8bit 8k VR videos for the complete process. More then twice the speed of realtime!

Keep in mind your results may vary as this is very dependent on your hardware. Cuda capable cards will have an advantage here. However, since the pipeline is largely CPU and video decode bottlenecked
a top of the line card like the 4090 is not required to get similar results. Having enough VRAM to run 3-6 processes, paired with a good CPU, will speed things up considerably though.

**Important considerations:**

- Each instance requires the YOLO model to load which means you'll need to keep checks on your VRAM to see how many you can load.
- The optimal number of instances depends on a combination of factors, including your CPU, GPU, RAM, and system configuration. So experiment with different setups to find the ideal configuration for your hardware! 😊

# Miscellaneous

- For VR only sbs (side by side) **Fisheye** and **Equirectangular** 180° videos are supported at the moment
- 2D POV videos are supported but work best when they are centered properly
- 2D / VR is automatically detected as is fisheye / equirectangular and FOV (make sure you keep the file format information in the filename _FISHEYE190, _MKX200, _LR_180, etc.)
- Detection settings can also be overwritten in the UI if the app doesn't detect it properly

---

# Output Files

The script generates the following files in a dedicated subfolder within your specified output directory:

1.  **`_preprocessed.mkv`**: A standardized video file used by the analysis stages for reliable frame processing.
2.  **`.msgpack`**: Raw YOLO detection data from Stage 1. Can be re-used to accelerate subsequent runs.
3.  **`_stage2_overlay.msgpack`**: Detailed tracking and segmentation data from Stage 2, used for debugging and visualization.
4.  **`_t1_raw.funscript`**: The raw, unprocessed funscript generated by the analysis before any enhancements are applied.
5.  **`.funscript`**: The final, post-processed funscript file for the primary (up/down) axis.
6.  **`.roll.funscript`**: The final funscript file for the secondary (roll/twist) axis, generated in 3-stage mode.
7.  **`.fgp`** (FunGen Project): A project file containing all settings, chapter data, and paths related to the video.

# About the project

## Pipeline Overview

The pipeline for generating Funscript files is as follows:

1.  **YOLO Object Detection**: A YOLO model detects relevant objects (e.g., penis, hands, mouth, etc.) in each frame of the video.
2.  **Tracking and Segmentation**: A custom tracking algorithm processes the YOLO detections to identify and segment continuous actions and interactions over time.
3.  **Funscript Generation**: Based on the mode (2-stage, 3-stage, etc.), the tracked data is used to generate a raw Funscript file.
4.  **Post-Processing**: The raw Funscript is enhanced with features like **Ultimate Autotune** to smooth motion, normalize intensity, and improve the overall quality of the final `.funscript` file.

## Project Genesis and Evolution

This project started as a dream to automate Funscript generation for VR videos. Here’s a brief history of its development:

- **Initial Approach (OpenCV Trackers)**: The first version relied on OpenCV trackers to detect and track objects in the video. While functional, the approach was slow (8–20 FPS) and struggled with occlusions and complex scenes.
- **Transition to YOLO**: To improve accuracy and speed, the project shifted to using YOLO object detection. A custom YOLO model was trained on a dataset of 1000nds annotated VR video frames, significantly improving detection quality.
- **Original Post**: For more details and discussions, check out the original post on EroScripts:

# Troubleshooting

## Installation Issues

### "unknown@unknown" or Git Permission Errors

If you see `[unknown@unknown]` in the application logs or git errors like "returned non-zero exit status 128":

**Cause:** The installer was run with administrator privileges, causing git permission/ownership issues.

**Solution 1 - Fix git permissions:**
```cmd
cd "C:\path\to\your\FunGen\FunGen"
git config --add safe.directory .
```

**Solution 2 - Reinstall as normal user:**
1. Redownload `install.bat`
2. Run it as a **normal user** (NOT as administrator)
3. Use the launcher script created by the installer instead of `python main.py`

### FFmpeg/FFprobe Not Found

If you get "ffmpeg/ffprobe not found" errors:

1. **Use the launcher script** (`launch.bat` or `launch.sh`) instead of running `python main.py` directly
2. **Rerun the installer** to get updated launcher scripts with FFmpeg PATH fixes
3. The launcher automatically adds FFmpeg to PATH

### General Installation Problems

1. **Always use launcher scripts** - Don't run `python main.py` directly
2. **Run installer as normal user** - Avoid administrator mode
3. **Rerun installer for updates** - Get latest fixes by rerunning the installer
4. **Check working directory** - Make sure you're in the FunGen project folder
